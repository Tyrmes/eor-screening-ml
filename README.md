# eor-screening-ml

This project consists of implementing an EOR Screening by using Machine Learning algorithms. It must be mentioned that the dataset used for training and evaluating these algorithms have a size of roughly 200 successful EOR Projects (Rows or observations) from some countries, as well as 7 reservoir parameters, which are the feature or dependent variables. Furthermore, the target variable of this model is a categorical variable, which contains 5 EOR Methods (classes) such as the steam injection method, CO2 injection method, HC injection method, polymer injection method, and combustion in situ method.

It is important to mention that the workflow followed by the project is shown as follows:
