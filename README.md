# eor-screening-ml

This project consists of implementing an EOR Screening by using Machine Learning algorithms. It must be mentioned that the dataset used for training and evaluating these algorithms have a size of roughly 200 successful EOR Projects (Rows or observations) from some countries, as well as 7 reservoir parameters, which are the feature or dependent variables. Furthermore, the target variable of this model is a categorical variable, which contains 5 EOR Methods (classes) such as the steam injection method, CO2 injection method, HC injection method, polymer injection method, and combustion in situ method.
